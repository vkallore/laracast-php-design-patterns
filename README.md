# Learing PHP Design patterns using Laracast's [Design Patterns in PHP](https://laracasts.com/series/design-patterns-in-php/)

## Decorator Pattern (Open/Closed Principle)

"Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification." _- Bertrand Meyer, 1988_

[Example](./decorators.php)

In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern (also known as wrapper, an alternative naming shared with the decorator pattern) that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.

An adaptor allows you to translate one interface for use with another.

[Example](./adapters)
